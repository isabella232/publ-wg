> *Ben Schroeter:* +1

**Tzviya Siegman:** last week Robin Seaman from Benetech passed away - amazing person - we will miss her tremendously - changed the world by her devotion to accessible publishing  

**Bill Kasdorf:** She put her heart and soul to a11y guide; her name will be associated with it.  

> *Ben Schroeter:* +1

> *Charles LaPierre:* Thanks everyone, yes we will

### 3. Scope and Revision of WP Document
{: #section3}

> *Franco Alvarado:* franco present+

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/wpub/blob/master/explainers/wpub-explainer.md#modularity](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/blob/master/explainers/wpub-explainer.md#modularity)

**Tzviya Siegman:** slimming down WP spec - shifting affordances to UCR doc - focus on metadata - then focus on modules  
… first module Audiopubs, then it might be mangas/comic books, scholar, education  
… details will go to modules  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://gist.github.com/iherman/1311da6cde8e564eb44036c7caf863d1#file-wg_scope-md](https://gist.github.com/iherman/1311da6cde8e564eb44036c7caf863d1#file-wg_scope-md)

**Ivan Herman:** I have written down my thoughts - see link above!  
… only 1 year left according to charter - we don't have too much time - we will have to establish a focus from now on - we had a hard core (the WP Manifest)  
… open issues are minor - the core sense of spec is to collect the metadata  
… we potentially have a number of profiles as specialized layers on top - may describe specific behaviors for special domains - audiobooks may be a first profile  
… profiles are WPs that may be deployed on the Web - deployment in browsers may require specialized scripts -  
… packaging should be generally useful for all profiles  
… current WP doc: title should be changed - remove affordances sections to UCR  
… we should revisit affordances and use cases doc - should it perhaps be a note? - separation of use cases and affordances?  
… separate spec for audio profile - should have a draft very soon  
… have a document for the packaging format we use now - need a decision on that  
… REC track for WP manifest and Audio profile  
… for a longer term - charter runs out in June 2021 - shall we continue? - we would then need a new charter - further topics for profiles: visual narrative, scholarly/educational, music, ...  
… web packaging - follow the further development  
… not discuss now whether it continues EPUB line or replaces EPUB  
… we have to decide on the scope for the presentation to the TAG  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Ivan's overview is excellent, but immediate focus on explainer doc and wp doc - we need to clean things up, to get them aligned  
… feedback on explainer @dauwhe?  

**Dave Cramer:** explainer as critical document, esp. for TAG review - not sure that inconsistencies between explainer and WP draft matter too much for TAG review  

**Tzviya Siegman:** if we try to coordinate too many things, it may get confusing. Affordances/use case document should be cleaned up and be separate from wp spec.  

**Ivan Herman:** whether draft should be synchronized with explainer? would prefer to synchronize these 2 docs  
… explainer doesn't really say where we are going - what are our goals? -  

**Tzviya Siegman:** adding a section on goals to explainer - I offer to write the goals up  

**Dave Cramer:** also ready to help in this effort  
… we have got real trouble with affordances - there are so many different kind of publications which aren't all on the Web - focusing on the core bits of metadata could be very valuable for us - I would like to use that data model to describe EPUB  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1 to dauwhe

> *Geoff Jukes:* +1 dauwhe

**Dave Cramer:** I would suggest that we would have varying vocabulary for different domains - maybe also different packaging formats for diverse needs  
… core data model that may be serialized and packaged in different ways  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/dauwhe/pdm/](https://github.com/dauwhe/pdm/)

**Avneesh Singh:** conceptually, this makes sense - delimit the scope because time is restricted - we have gone little beyond the core - what are we restricting, do we stretch to sth else?  

**Ivan Herman:** so far we only thought of moving the affordances section  
… some types of contributors that are only relevant for audiobooks - most of the statements may stay where they are  
… On the data model: I'm scared to go down the line Dave proposed - seeing the time, it would be dangerous to revisit the data model  
… one important message: data model based on existing standards (schema.org) - don't see necessity of revising our data model - would be an enormous amount of work  

**Dave Cramer:** concerned to use deadlines and time as basis for design choices  

**Ivan Herman:** we decided in Lyon to take out the abstract info model in favor of JSON-LD  

**Dave Cramer:** Blackstone use case - an HTML serialization is much more complicated than needed - can we explain EPUB as an aspect of our larger work on publications  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Dave's 2 points are pretty meaningful - it integrates EPUB - scary to state that EPUB is totally different from WP - it's very valuable to work with schema.org, but we should not rule out other possibilities  

**Laurent Le Meur:** too late to revise data model now - Blackstone: where HTML entry page is not used being too heavy - sufficient to state that HTML entry page is optional -  
… we must move on and finalize what we are working until now  

**Ivan Herman:** a lot of groups in a similar situation did: publish a note with the abstract model (in sync with the JSON-LD serialization)  
… JSON-LD WG will work on a version serializing YAML in JSON-LD - not started yet  

**Tzviya Siegman:** we decided to simplify at TPAC by what's wrong with an abstract data model?  

**Ivan Herman:** we defined an abstract model and serialized it in JSON-LD - documenting the data model independently from the syntax used for serialization would be OK  

**Dave Cramer:** we should describe the components to build different kinds of publications - moving affordances out from spec is a good first step - I would be more radical  

**Laurent Le Meur:** very different affordances also dependent on UA - schema.org provides a model and different serializations - we chose JSON-LD - how would be describe the data model - UML? waste of time  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#introduction](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#introduction)

**Benjamin Young:** publication is a linear progression of these items - web annotation data model included a brief explanation how we modeled this - trivial and small, but essential to understanding the following  

**Dave Cramer:** map our terms to other vocabularies - "readingOrder" = "spine" in EPUB  

**Ivan Herman:** my proposal: we make a separate document/note on the data model  

**Tzviya Siegman:** scope is to refine the WP doc - strip out affordances, refine manifest  
… more volunteers on affordances needed  
… WP doc should only define Manifest and metadata  
… audiopubs as stand-alone module  

> *Wendy Reid:* +1 to both

> *Garth Conboy:* +1

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1

**Bill Kasdorf:** Will all future modules have REC status and won't contradict each other?  
… will they be consistent?  

**Wendy Reid:** there should be communication with the PWG and all use the manifest  

**Avneesh Singh:** if only one module the core spec may be skewed to fit that single module - we should have more than on module in parallel  

> *Wendy Reid:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** +1 to Avneesh - it make sense to have a further module, but not yet on a rec-track basis  

**Dave Cramer:** demanding an EPUB module  

> *Luc Audrain:* EPUB 4?

**Wendy Reid:** more than one module makes it easier to distinguish core and module  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Dave and I will revise explainer, we need to revise UCR, Matt will concentrate on spec
