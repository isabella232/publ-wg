### 3. manifest discussion issue
{: #section3}

> *Wendy Reid:* See [Issue #31 "Is there a need for both an authored and a canonical manifests"](https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues/31)

> *Wendy Reid:* See [Issue #32 "Should we use JSON schemas as part of the spec?"](https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues/32)

> *Wendy Reid:* See [summary of the discussions and decisions to be taken](https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues/31#issuecomment-521096482), read here:


> 1. Do we allow the usage of full JSON-LD for the publication manifest, or only a restricted "subset" (or shape) thereof. Put it another way, do we expect reading systems that use the manifest to include a full JSON-LD processor? (This is, in fact, issue #32.)
>
> 2. Do we need the differentiation (and corresponding conversion method) between an "authored" manifest and a "canonical" manifest, where the former is a simplified version of the latter (e.g., allowing the author to use simple convention to express the manifest information in its full complexity)? (See the example of @llemeurfr's example in #31 (comment) to illustrate it)

**Ivan Herman:** we moved a bit last week and getting to a consensus among those who discussed all this. The proposed answer to the first question is _no_, ie, we would use just a specific "shape" of JSON-LD. There would be an informal reference to a JSON-Schema to define that shape.  

**George Kerscher:** A fully implemented json processor would be able to process this subset and so would a reading system so we have this covered, yes?  

**Ivan Herman:** yes.  
… the other issue is canonical manifest. The proposed consensus is the get rid of the term 'canonical' manifest.  
… There is already a (WebIDL) definition in the document that is used by the processor. Matt is working with the conversion algorithm that says here is the manifest and here is how I use it to convert it into the data structure defined by WebIDL. I think that the discussion on the issue shows that we are in agreement  
… matt's work is not yet done and so this will not be in the first public working draft  
… the question is if there is a consensus  

**Wendy Reid:** are there any comments?  

**Benjamin Young:** the overall direction is the right one but we do need to review the writing when it's done because it will clarify some of the confusion  
… shape is a better term in this case than subset  

> **Proposed resolution: (1) only a shape of JSON-LD is required; this will be further defined through an (informative) reference to a JSON schema. This should close issue #32. (2) instead of the canonical manifest only an internal data structure is used, and the canonicalization algo. maps onto this. This closes issue #31** *(Ivan Herman)*

{: #section6}

**Wendy Reid:** I think I will be attending  

> *Luc Audrain:* Good news !

**Wendy Reid:** end of this week is the deadline for adding suggestions to the agenda  
… Please fill it out this week  

### 7. Proposed Closing issues
{: #section7}

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/audiobooks/issues](https://github.com/w3c/audiobooks/issues)

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues](https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues)

**Wendy Reid:** please take a look at these lists of proposed issues to close and let me know today if you have any objections to closing any of them  
… otherwise they will be closed today  

> *Laurent Le Meur:* +1

### 8. Add linked resource property called 'alternative'
{: #section8}

> *Luc Audrain:* See [Issue #33](https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/issues/33)

**Wendy Reid:** this is to facilitate the use case for synch media  
… we realized that there wasn't anything in synched media that allowed for this so I suggested this issue be opened against manifest  
… this affects more than just audiobook  

**Ivan Herman:** this is the written version of an audio track?  
… it's value is the url to a resource?  
… but it must be present in the links in the manifest?  
… I imagine it could be done automatically in those transformations  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** I like the idea of not having it be strict  

**Matt Garrish:** There's no reason it couldn't be an array as well as a value, correct?  

**Wendy Reid:** yeah, I think you could have multiple alternatives  

**Ivan Herman:** I am backpedaling  
… if I do it automatically then the media type will not be clear - especially if we do what Matt says  
… I don't think we have an automatic deduction of the media type  

> *Laurent Le Meur:* See [Example of a similar structure in Readium](https://github.com/readium/webpub-manifest/blob/master/extensions/audiobook.md#3-alternate-audio-resources)

> *Laurent Le Meur:* See [Example for usage of a similar construction](https://api.archivelab.org/books/art_letters_1809_librivox/opds_audio_manifest)

**Laurent Le Meur:** there are some potential implementations on the market  
… I support Ivan's proposals  

**Ivan Herman:** I would like if this came in like a pull request on the manifest document with all the right information  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** I can give it a shot  

**Ivan Herman:** thanks, mattg has his hands full  

**Benjamin Young:** how does this work with rel alternate? will that be confusing? whoever writes the pull request should be careful to clarify  

**Laurent Le Meur:** one is about alternative publication and the other is about alternative media, it's a different level of semantics  

**Ivan Herman:** the new proposal, the alternate is the target - the rel characterizes the resource  
… I am giving a sound alternative to a text  

**Benjamin Young:** and that's the definition of rel alternate in HTML  

**Ivan Herman:** but not in JSON-LD  

> **Proposed resolution: there is an in principle agreement with the proposal, a PR will follow with the details** *(Wendy Reid)*
