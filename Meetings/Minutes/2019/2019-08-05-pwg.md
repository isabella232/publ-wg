**Garth Conboy:** shall we approve the minutes?  

**all:** silence  

> ***Resolution #1: last week's minutes approved***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Garth Conboy:** minutes approved  

### 1. publication schedules
{: #section1}

**Garth Conboy:** UCR, Web Pub as notes  
… the packaging doc as a note  
… web pub manifest and audio as rec track  

#### 1.1. WPUB and UCR Notes
{: #section1-1}

**Garth Conboy:** ivan, do you want to talk about where we are on the first two?  

**Ivan Herman:** the UCR is ready to go  
… I have cross-checked it with the checkers  
… it has to be published by the webmaster... Thursday is possible  
… but we should sync with web publication note  
… Matt would know where we are with WPUB note  

> *Matt Garrish:* See [Open PR for the WPUB Note](https://github.com/w3c/wpub/pull/461)

**Matt Garrish:** we have an open PR (see above)  
… that's to add in the status of this doc, the final proposed text  
… otherwise it's publishing it verbatim  
… what we probably need is consensus to publish as a note  
… if we can get that, it's not a big issue  

**Ivan Herman:** that's correct  
… the clean thing is to have a formal resolution  
… we have this already for UCR  

**Garth Conboy:** is that a matter of wanting a consensus on this call?  

**Ivan Herman:** yes  

**Luc Audrain:** there are five documents  
… the three last ones are related  
… and the two first ones are  
… ivan, you said...  

**Garth Conboy:** UCR has references to web publications, so they should go concurrently  
… we have consensus to publish UCR, but not yet to do WPUB  

**Luc Audrain:** you answered :)  

**Garth Conboy:** do we have consensus to publish WPUB as a note?  

> **Proposed resolution: Publish the WPUB as a Note based on PR #461** *(Ivan Herman)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Tim Cole:* +1

**Garth Conboy:** is consensus is on the call sufficient?  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Garth Conboy:* +1

> *Matt Garrish:* +1

> *Joshua Pyle:* +1

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

> *Romain Deltour:* +1

> *Jun Gamou:* +1

> *George Kerscher:* +1

> *Marisa DeMeglio:* +1

> *Rachel Comerford:* +1

> *Luc Audrain:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: Publish the WPUB as a Note based on PR #461***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Garth Conboy:** we have consensus  

**Ivan Herman:** on the practicalities, matt you can ping me when it's ready to go? Then I'll take it to webmaster  
… I'll try for Thursday, if not it will be next week  

#### 1.2. rec-track publications (Audiobooks and manifest) and Lightweight Packaging
{: #section1-2}

**Garth Conboy:** the bottom 3 is packaging, audio, and manifest  
… we might be better off with dropping the "web" in front of publication manifest to avoid confusion  
… and discussion on that?  

**Ivan Herman:** I am ok with it  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

**Dave Cramer:** I think we should remove the word "web"  

> *Luc Audrain:* +1 to dauwhe

**Matt Garrish:** we've not called this the WPUB manifest, if we're pulling out publication manifest, we should continue not to call it the web publication manifest  
… and it avoids some legacy baggage  
… we're making a break from web publications and working on other things  
… we're working on a more general manifest  

> **Proposed resolution: change "Web Publication Manifest" to "Publication Manifest"** *(Garth Conboy)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Garth Conboy:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Dave Cramer:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Matt Garrish:* +1

> *Luc Audrain:* +1

> *Franco Alvarado:* +1

> *Romain Deltour:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *Rachel Comerford:* +1

> *Joshua Pyle:* +1

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

> *Marisa DeMeglio:* +1

> *George Kerscher:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Proposal: change "Web Publication Manifest" to "Publication Manifest"***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Garth Conboy:** so we have three publications  
… we have packaging, which would be a note  
… and audio and manifest would be rec  

**Ivan Herman:** yes  
… we did agree packaging is a note  

**Garth Conboy:** the agenda had us making a plan for a schedule to publish these  
… I am open to suggestions  
… given that REC is harder than note we should discuss packaging separately  
… laurent, what about open issues?  
… we have a working draft  

**Laurent Le Meur:** at the moment it's separate text, I have to know if I have to include inside audiobook doc, or if it should be separate  

**Ivan Herman:** the questions could arise whether the publication manifest should be put together with audio as one big document  
… last week we said it would be better separate, so other things could use it  
… the same argument would apply to packaging  
… it's better for it to stay as a separate note  

**Garth Conboy:** the different statuses imply that  

**Laurent Le Meur:** I have to add one para about not deflating binary resources  
… which is already in EPUB 3  
… and packaging is the proper place for that. I can add by end of the week.  
… I also need to change the structure of the files  
… and I must do some kitchen work :)  
… maybe I'll need your help, Ivan  

> ***Action #1: create a separate LPF repository (Ivan Herman)***
{: #action1 .action}

**Ivan Herman:** I will create a separate repo  

**George Kerscher:** just want to make clear  
… you're not going to compress the audio files, which are already compressed with a codec? You're not going to re-compress?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** exactly  

**Garth Conboy:** with a para to be added and some kitchen cleanup, what timeframe?  
… maybe on the 19th?  

**Laurent Le Meur:** that's ok for me  

**Ivan Herman:** from a public relations point of view, it would be a good idea if the audio, manifest, and packaging were published at the same time  
… I don't know if we have an agreed date for the other two  

**Garth Conboy:** we can probably do a date for manifest, but I can't speak for Wendy on a date for audio  

**Ivan Herman:** we can propose something then we can revisit  

**Garth Conboy:** then can we get consensus for all three two weeks from today?  

**Ivan Herman:** two weeks from today, you mean that on the 19th these documents are ready to be reviewed by this group?  

**Garth Conboy:** and we would use that call to make a pub decision  

**Matt Garrish:** I started working at pulling manifest out of WPUB  
… we need new infrastructure, new repos, new short names  
… I think we could do in two weeks?  
… we also have to update audiobooks because of xrefs  
… we can target two weeks and check in next week  

**Ivan Herman:** for what you ask, setting up a repo is not a big deal. I can do it tomorrow.  
… it is good if the repo name reflects the short name  
… so we should agree on that now.  

**George Kerscher:** once the WG publishing these three documents as notes  

**Garth Conboy:** one as note and two as working drafts  

**George Kerscher:** what happens to notes after the WG is closed? who maintains those notes?  

**Ivan Herman:** for notes, any other group can keep them up  
… the publishing CG could experiment with the WPUB note, for example  
… REC is different  

**Matt Garrish:** the obvious short name would be pubmanifest or pub-manifest  

**Garth Conboy:** pubman  

**Matt Garrish:** how short do we want to make it? :)  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 to pub-manifest

**Garth Conboy:** I tend to think what makes mgarrish and ivan happy works  

> **Proposed resolution: the short name for Publication Manifest will be pub-manifest** *(Ivan Herman)*

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

> *David Stroup:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: the short name for Publication Manifest will be pub-manifest***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Garth Conboy:** that's on you?  

**Ivan Herman:** that's on me  

> ***Action #2: set up a repository for pub-manifest (Ivan Herman)***
{: #action2 .action}

**Garth Conboy:** I have a proposal

> *Laurent Le Meur:* +1

> ***Resolution #5: Have all three (LPF, Publication Manifest, Audiobooks) ready for Publication and consensus by the group to go ahead with Publication on August 19***
{: #resolution5 .resolution}

#### 1.3. planning
{: #section1-3}

**Ivan Herman:** let's prepare ourselves  
… the 19th should be when we agree on everything, the docs would go out that week or the week after  
… we should plan for ourselves, we should read those docs so that at TPAC we can work on those docs to get them ready for CR  

### 2. Misc
{: #section2}

> *Dave Cramer:* Garth any other business for this call?

**Ivan Herman:** thanks to Dave for scribing and Matt for joining us on a holiday  

**David Stroup:** I don't know if anything's been done yet  
… kenneth from my team is joining  
… he's on the call today  

**Kenneth Dougherty:** hello everyone  

**Joshua Pyle:** if there's an award for the most proposals in a meeting we should nominate garth  

**Garth Conboy:** any other business? going twice?  
… we'll have Wendy back next week.  
… thanks all!
