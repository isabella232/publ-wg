Philippe, Ralph,

the AC Review for the Publication Manifest and the Audiobooks Recommendations:

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/audiobooks-pr/

have ended yesterday. There were 23, resp. 22, votes to publish as is (or with a minor editorial comment), and 1, resp. 2, abstentions. Do I have your approval to go ahead?

FYI, the publication is planned for the 10th of November.

Thanks

Ivan
