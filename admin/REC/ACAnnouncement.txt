[DRAFT] Publication Manifest and Audiobooks are W3C Recommendations
-------------------------------------------


Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,
   
It is my pleasure to announce that the Publication Manifest and the Audiobooks specifications are now W3C Recommendations:

Publication Manifest
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-pub-manifest-20201110/

Audiobooks
	https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-audiobooks-20201110/

The Publication Manifest specification defines a general manifest format for expressing information about a digital publication. It uses schema.org metadata augmented to include various structural properties about publications, and serialized in JSON-LD, to enable interoperability between publishing formats while accommodating variances in the information that needs to be expressed.

The Audiobooks specification describes the requirements for the creation of audiobooks, using a profile of the Publication Manifest specification.

All Members who responded to the Call for Review [1] of the Proposed Recommendation showed support (with two abstentions), with several reviewers indicating that they produce or expect to produce products that use this specification.

Please join us in congratulating the W3C Publishing Working Group [2] on this achievement.

Thank you,

For Tim Berners-Lee, Director, and
Philippe Le HÃ©garet, Project Management Lead;
Ivan Herman, Publishing Working Group Staff Contact;
Xueyuan Jia, W3C Marketing & Communications
