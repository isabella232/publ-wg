IPR Status
----------

This document has been extracted from:
    - Web Publications: https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/
  
which used to be a Rec-track document and is now a WG Note. The new document is what was called "Part I" of the old one, with some editorial changes. This means that the IPR commitments for the old document[1] should be automatically valid for the new one, too.

The document has already been installed; it passes pubrules and the link checker, except for the usage rel=publication. This has been entered as an exception for the /TR/wpub case, this exception should now be set for /TR/pub-manifest, too.

The right 'bucket' on our TR page for the documents is "Digital Publishing". 

Thanks!

Ivan
