Note, however, that this document has been extracted from:
    - Web Publications: https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/
  
which used to be a Rec-track document and is now a WG Note. Essentially, the new document is what was called "Part I" of the old one, with a number of editorial changes. This means that the IPR commitments for the old document[1] should be automatically valid for the new one, too.

The document have already been installed; they all pass pubrules and the link checker.

The right 'bucket' on our TR page for the documents is "Digital Publishing". 

Thanks!

Ivan
