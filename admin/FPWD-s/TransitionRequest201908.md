# Transition Request: one document of the Publishing Working Group to FPWD

Philippe and Ralph,

The Web Publication Working Group has resolved [1] to request publication of a FPWD of:

    - Publication Manifest:
        - https://w3c.github.io/pub-manifest/?specStatus=FPWD
 
    
Since this is the first publication of these documents, please also approve the shortname: pub-manifest. The estimated publication date is 27 August 2019. 

Note that this document has been extracted from:
    - Web Publications: https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/
  
which used to be a Rec-track document and is now a WG Note. Essentially, the new document is what was called "Part I" of the old one, with a number of editorial changes. This means that the IPR commitments for the old document[2] should be automatically valid for the new one, too.

There were no Formal Objections to publishing this FPWD.

This request is sent per "How to Organize a Technical Report Transition" [3].

For the co-Chairs of the Web Publications Working Group,
Ivan Herman
