(Coralie, Xueyuan, this is for information only; I will send you the HPN news draft separately)

Denis,

This is an official publication request for the publication of a Working Group First Public Note on behalf of the Publishing Working Group. The publication date is the 05 of December, 2019. The transition request for FPWD has been issued in:
	- https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/191

the Director's approval is in:
	- https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/191#issuecomment-556332069


The document is as follows:
----------------------------

- Lightweight Packaging Format (LPF):
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/NOTE-lpf-20191205/

Abstract and Status Sections
----------------------------

See the previous URL-s.

The right 'bucket' on our TR page for the documents is "Digital Publishing". 

The document have already been installed. The link checker passes, but the pubrules checker gives a strange error. It asks for the status section to include an attribute "data-deliverer" (it is the first time I see this requirement) and misses the status section. I did add the data attribute, but it continues to complain about the missing status section (which is there). I have the impression that this is a checker error; please advise. (The error message refers to a <p> element, while respec generates a <section>, may that be the problem?)

One more note: the publication of this note will be synchronized with the publication of two CR documents:

https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/190

we will delay the publication of the CR until this publication is done. Xueyuan, Coralie, the announcement texts I will send you cover all three documents.

Thanks!

Ivan
