## First Public Working Draft: Publication Manifest

The [W3C Publishing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/) has published a [First Public Working Draft on Publication Manifest](https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest) today. This specification defines a general manifest format for expressing information about a digital publication. It uses [schema.org](https://schema.org) metadata augmented to include various structural properties about publications, serialized in [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/), to enable interoperability between publishing formats while accommodating variances in the information that needs to be expressed.

This manifest format had originally been developed as part of larger work on [Web Publications](https://www.w3.org/TR/wpub/). As a result of some recent discussions, the publication schedule of the group has been modified and, while the Web Publication has been published as a Working Group Note, the Publication Manifest has become a stand-alone, recommendation track document. See a [separate blog by Wendy Reid](https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/08/changes-to-the-publication-schedule-for-the-publishing-working-group/) on the backgrounds of this decision.
