Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

The Director is pleased to announce the approval of the Audiobooks Working Group charter:
   https://www.w3.org/2020/11/audiobooks-wg-charter.html

The group is chartered through 31 December 2022.

With the successful publication of the Publication Manifest and the Audiobooks Recommendations by the Publishing Working Group[1], the mission of the Audiobooks Working Group is to maintain these Recommendations and related Working Group Notes.

This Working Group is a continuation of the previous Publishing Working Group[2], with a similar scope and a reduced focus.

Please use the following form to join the group. The form will also instruct you how to nominate participants:
   https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/100074/join

Because the group is rechartered under the new Patent Policy 2020, current participants of the Publishing Working Group[2] will need to rejoin the group.

The Working Group Chair are Garth Conboy (Google), Wendy Reid (Rakuten, Inc.), and Tzviya Siegman (John Wiley & Sons., Inc.). Team Contact is Ivan Herman for a total of 0.05 FTE.

More information about the Audiobooks Working Group can be found on the group’s home page:
