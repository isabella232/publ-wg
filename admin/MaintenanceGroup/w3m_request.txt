Following the successful AC vote, closed on the 30th of October, for the Audiobooks WG charter:

   https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/audiobooks-wg/

which had 26 responders, all in favor, I would like the Director to approve the charter at:

   https://www.w3.org/2020/11/audiobooks-wg-charter.html

There were only editorial changes on the charter text since the AC review started:

- Anticipating the publication of the corresponding Recommendations (DD pending[1]) the references have been updated
- The relevant charter history table row on the proposal have been clarified

Thanks

Ivan
