Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
Chairs,

This is a Call for Review of a proposed recharter for the Publishing Working Group (under the name Audiobooks Working Group):
      https://www.w3.org/2020/09/proposed-audiobooks-wg-charter.html

Please review the charter and indicate your support using this online form:
      https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/audiobooks-wg/

The deadline for responses is 23:59 Boston time on 2020-10-30.

The Working Group will maintain the Audiobooks specifications (i.e., Publication Manifest and Audiobooks) that together provide an easy way of creating Audiobooks, i.e., a collection of audio resources grouped together by a reading order, metadata, and resources, all contained in a manifest. This Audiobook can live on the Open Web Platform, or as a packaged entity.

There are no new deliverables with licensing obligations under the W3C Patent Policy. Current group [1] participants will not need to re-join under the new charter.

Proposed Team Contact time is 0.05 FTE.

If you have any questions or need further information, please contact: Ivan Herman, Audiobooks WG Staff Contact, at ivan@w3.org

This charter review follows section 5 of the W3C Process Document:

Thank you,

For Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director;
